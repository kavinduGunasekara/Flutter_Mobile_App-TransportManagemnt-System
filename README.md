## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, universities strive to provide the best possible services to their students, lecturers, and staff members. One essential service that many universities offer is a reliable transport facility. The KDU Southern Campus (KDUSC) in Sri Lanka recognized the need for an efficient and streamlined transport management system.

The current transport system at KDUSC operates manually, posing numerous challenges. Managing bus locations, passenger payments, and ensuring available seats for passengers commuting to and from the university becomes a cumbersome task. To overcome these difficulties and improve the overall transportation experience, an automated transport management system is being developed.

The goal of this project is to create a centralized system that simplifies and enhances the management of transport services at KDUSC. The Automated Transport Management System will provide a range of services, including real-time bus updates, seat reservations, live bus tracking, payment options (monthly or daily), and monitoring of passenger entrances and exits. All data and transactions within the system will be securely stored in a centralized database. Access to this database will be limited to authorized administrators, who will also have the capability to register new users into the system.

By implementing this automated transport management system, KDUSC aims to optimize its transport operations, ensuring better service delivery, increased efficiency, and enhanced convenience for passengers. With improved tracking, reservation, and payment functionalities, the system will streamline the entire transport process, making it easier for passengers to plan their journeys and for the university to manage its transport resources effectively.

## Features

### For Admin:

- **Manage Passengers:** Admin can add, update, or delete passenger details, including names, destinations, and payment information.
- **View Passenger List:** Admin can view a list of passengers who are using the bus for a particular journey.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Admin can send notifications to passengers, including reminders to update their journey status and payment notifications.
- **Additional Seats:** Admin can receive requests for additional seats, and the system will check if they can be allocated based on availability.

### For Drivers:

- **Real-time Passenger List:** Drivers can access a real-time list of passengers on their bus.
- **Start of Journey Notification:** Drivers are notified when the journey begins.

### For Passengers:

- **Journey Status:** Passengers can set their journey status as "Going" or "Not Going."
- **Entry/Exit Tollway:** Passengers can input entry and exit tollway information.
- **Additional Seats:** Passengers can request additional seats if needed.
- **Change Journey Status:** Passengers can change their journey status.
- **Real-time Bus Location:** Passengers can view the real-time location of the bus on a map.
- **Payment Notifications:** Passengers receive notifications regarding payment details.
- **View Attendance:** Passengers can view attendance records.

## Problem Statement

The existing transport system at KDUSC relies on a WhatsApp group for sharing bus start and arrival times and real-time bus locations. This manual system leads to issues such as time wastage, lack of order, and inconvenience to passengers.

## Aims & Objectives

### Aims

The main aim of the project is to improve the efficiency of the university's transport system for lecturers by implementing an automated mobile app.

### Objectives

1. **Develop a Mobile App:** Design and develop a mobile phone app specifically for the university's transportation system with a user-friendly interface.
2. **Automate Passenger Management:** Automate the process of managing passenger details to reduce manual paperwork and improve data accuracy.
3. **Implement Live Location Tracking:** Integrate live location tracking into the mobile app to allow passengers to view real-time bus locations on a map.
4. **Enhance Communication:** Enhance communication between administrative staff and passengers through real-time notifications.
